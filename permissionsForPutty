Give permissions through putty, so that we can upload files directly using FileZilla

To allow user ec2-user (Amazon AWS) write access to the public web directory (/var/www/html),
enter this command via Putty or Terminal, as the root user sudo:

chown -R ec2-user /var/www/html

Make sure permissions on that entire folder were correct:

chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
